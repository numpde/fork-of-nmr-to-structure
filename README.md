# NMR to Structure

This code accompanies the paper [Learning the Language of NMR: Structure Elucidation from NMR spectra using Transformer Models](https://ibm.biz/nmr_to_struc). The repo contains scripts to simulate NMR spectra, prepare the data and train models.


## Installation guide

Create a conda environment for the scripts:

```
conda create -n nmr python=3.9
conda activate nmr
```

Clone the repository and instal via: 

```
pip install .
```

For development install via:

```
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Simulating NMR spectra

This section explains how to simulate NMR spectra using MestreNova. A working version of MestreNova is required. 

### Running the simulations

Running the MestreNova script requires a .csv file containing SMILES of the molecules for which NMR spectra will be generated. This .csv file requires one columns, `Smiles`. The index of the smiles is used to name the output files. An 'example.csv' is provided. To run the simulations run the following script:

```
run_simulation --smiles_csv example/smiles.csv --out_folder example/simulation_out/1H --sim_type 1H --mnova_path <Absolute Path to your MestreNova executable> --script_path <Absolute path to the folder containing the MestreNova scripts>
```

The MestreNova simulation scripts can be found here -- [mestre_nova_scripts](src/nmr_to_structure/nmr_generation/mestre_nova_scripts). 
This script uses the MestreNova scripting tool to run the simulations. As a result all MestreNova will be opened and you will be able to see how spectra are simulated. A file is saved for each molecule.

To run the simulations for <sup>13</sup>C simply replace the `--sim_type` with `13C`.


### Compiling the data

After running the script the files need to be compiled into one dataframe making handling easier. This can be accomplished via the `gather_data` script. To gather the data from the <sup>1</sup>H simulation from the above example use:

```
gather_data --results_folder example/simulation_out/1H --out_path example/simulation_out/results.pkl --sim_type 1H
```

This compiles the data into a format readable by the scripts to prepare the data for training. In the above example the dataframe only contains <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra. To include <sup>13</sup>C NMRs as well, use the optional argument `--add_to_existing_df` upon which the additional NMR information will be added to the same dataframe and saved according to the path set with `--out_path`. Additionally, set the `--sim_type` to `13C`.


## Preparing the input data

The following scripts will use the data generated in the previous steps, format the NMRs, tokenize the strings and split into a train, test and validation set. 

### Task 1: NMR to Structure
This script can be used to prepare training data for a model that predicts the structure from the NMR. Using the data from above, training data can be prepared as such:

```
prepare_nmr_input --nmr_data example/simulation_out/results.pkl --out_path example/training/data --mode hnmr
```
The above command will prepare training data for a model that predicts the structure solely from a <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Further options are available as described in the paper.

### Task 2: Reaction data + NMR to Structure

The following script prepares training data for the second task of predicting the correct molecule from a set given the NMR spectrum. Additionally, a file containg reactions from which to build the molecule sets is required. The script expects this file to be a pickled dataframe of one column  Use the following syntax to run the script:

```
prepare_nmr_rxn_input --nmr_data example/simulation_out/results.pkl --rxn_data <path to Reaction file> --out_path example/training/1H --mode hnmr
```


## Training a model

Run a training of the model using the run_training.py script. This script requires a directory with a subfolder called data which contains the training, validation and test data as generated by the two scripts above. Another requirement is a path to a OpenNMT configuration template. The template with which all trainings were performed in the template is provided in src/nmr_to_structure/training/transformer_template.yaml.

For the example try:
```
train_model --template_path src/nmr_to_structure/training/transformer_template.yaml --data_folder example/training
```
Note: The template expects a GPU to be present and to run a real training much more data is required.

For testing purposes, training a model for only few steps with a tiny model on CPU only:
```
train_model --template_path src/nmr_to_structure/training/transformer_template_tiny_cpu.yaml --data_folder example/training/1H
```
## Inference
Run the following command to do inference:
```
onmt_translate -model <model_path> -src <src_path> -output <out_file> -beam_size 10 -n_best 10 -min_length 5 -gpu 0
```
For the example (dummy model, valid set, CPU only), this corresponds to the following:

```
onmt_translate -model example/training/1H/model_step_5.pt -src example/training/1H/data/src-val.txt -output example/training/1H/pred-val.txt -beam_size 10 -n_best 10 -min_length 5
```

## Scoring
Scoring can be done via the score.py script:

```
python scripts/score.py --tgt_path <path to tgt file> --inference_path <out file from inference> 
```

For the example above:

```
score_model --tgt_path example/training/1H/data/tgt-val.txt --inference_path example/training/1H/pred-val.txt
```

Use --n_beams if the beam size is changed from 10 during inference.
